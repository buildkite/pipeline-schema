## Usage

### npm package

The schema is provided as a [package on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/buildkite-pipeline-schema).

You can install it in your project:

```sh
npm i buildkite-json-schema
```

```js
// CommonJS
const schema = require("buildkite-pipeline-schema");

// ESM
import schema from "buildkite-json-schema" assert { type: "json" };
```

Or use it with via a CDN:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://unpkg.com/buildkite-pipeline-schema@latest/schema.json"
  // ...
}
```

### Editor integration

You can lint and validate your `pipeline.yml` files using an editor extension that supports [RedHat YAML Language Server](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server#clients).

#### VSCode

Install the [YAML VSCode Extension by Red Hat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml).
