# Contributing

1. Create a fork of this repository to commit your changes to.
1. Make your changes, and include some [tests](#Tests).
1. Create a pull request, and include a description of your changes. Ideally, include a link to the relevant documentation in the [Buildkite Pipelines docs](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/configuration-overview).

## Tests

The schema is tested by validating example schemas (see [`test/valid-pipelines`](../test/valid-pipelines/)). Please extend these or add a new one to verify your changes.

## Review

Our objective is to have no pull request wait more than a week for some sort of interaction from us â€” this might be a review, or it might be a "I'm going to come back to this and review it a bit later". This isn't a guarantee though, and sometimes other work might get in the way of reviewing open source contributions. If we're really dragging our feet on reviewing a PR, please feel free to ping us through GitHub or Slack, or get in touch with support@buildkite.com, and they can bug us to get things done :smile:
